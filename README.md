Above is a collection of guides relating to minescript, a client-side mod for minecraft that features python programming.

Starting programming is hard, but having actual applications to apply concepts to makes the experience a lot more fun along the way.

My guides are here as a quickstart to help guide people through this process and document harder-to-understand features.

If you would like me to include a specific guide, message me and I will do so.
